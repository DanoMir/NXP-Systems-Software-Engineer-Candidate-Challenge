## About
This document details the System design and architectural justification for the NXP Virtual Sensor Platform Driver. The primary goal was to create a robust, low-latency telemetry and control system. The Platform Driver (Kernel Space) simulates a sensor thet generates Dynamic Temperature Samples periodically via an hrtimer, which are consumed by a User Space CLI. The architecture is validated to ensure safe asynchronous communication and low CPU consumption via the implement notification mechanism.


## 1. Architecture

This project implements a Telemetry and Control System designed for low-latency soft real-time operation on a standard Linux Kernel. The system operates asynchronously with low consumtion, where the Kernel's High Resolution Timer (hrtimer) acts as the Producer generating dynamic temperature samples using get_random_bytes() every n ms and the User Space application consumes data efficiently via a Wait Queue notification channel ensuring an optimal performance. When the hrtimer produces a sample, the driver calls wake_up_interruptible() on the Wait Queue (dev->wq). This mechanism changes the User Space processes state from Sleeping to Ready to Run, allowing the poll/epoll syscall to return immediately and consume the accumulated data from the Ring Buffer. This architecture ensures optimal, event-driven performance by avoiding continuous polling and maximizing CPU efficiency.

 
### 2.- Concurrency and Sincronization

The implementation of a Ring Buffer is used for effcient data management between the Producer and Consumer operating in different rates. Concurrency is handled using a Spinlock to protect the shared Ring Buffer and the alerts_count counter. This choice is mandatory because the Producer (hrtimer callback) executes in Softirq/Interrupt Context, which cannot sleep (preventing the use of Mutexes). This ensures atomic access between the kernel timer and User Space processes running on different CPU cores.


### 3. API Contract, Control and Robustness

The communication interface Kernel-User Space is performed by means of two channels to ensure a clean flow.

    * The Data Path (/dev/simtemp): This Character Device is used for the transfer of binary payload through struct simtemp_sample.
    The nxp_simtemp_read() function was implemented with a while loop for handle the blocking/non blocking logic, enabling batch consumption for User Space efficiently.

    * The Control Path (sysfs): This system is used to Dynamic Configuration and Diagnosis (on-the-fly) through ASCII strings. The sampling_ms_store function runs the critical atomic sequence of hrtimer_cancel -> Update Period -> hrtimer_start under a Spinlock to reconfigurate the timing without race conditions.


### 4. Robustness

The Persistent Alert is cleaned by the 'sysfs clear_alert' and the decrement logic in 'read()', to ensure that 'alerts_count' be reset when get in User Space and prevents Sticky Flags and False Wake-Ups. 

Device Tree Parsing: The Driver implements DT parsing through 'of_property_read_u32' to configuration of 'sampling_ms' and 'threshold_mC'. In the host development environment, the Driver uses a fallback mechanism  to hard-coded values, demonstrating robustness of code and a fallback mechanism against by an unpopulated DT at boot time.


### 5. Validation

The project utilizes a robust two-testing methodology to validate functionality and stability, driven by automates shell scripts.

* 6.1. Asertive Test (run_demo.sh --test): This mode executes a formal unit test of the Alert Path which successfully forces the SUCCESS path (low threshold) and FAIL path (high threshold) paths, confirming and demonstrating the System limit handling through the correct interptetation of values with established limits. 

* 6.2. Continuous Monitoring Test ( run_monitor.sh): This mode provides live evidence of data stability. The resulting log confirms that samples are continuous, dynamic (non-repetitive), and mantain the precise configured sampling rate (e.g. 200 ms). This validates the efficiency of the hrtimer and the stable operation of the Ring Buffer in a real time environment.


### 6. Escalability

Scalability is ensured by the Bounded Ring Buffer and the Batch Reading Pattern, which prevents the CPU from being saturated by processing large amounts of samples per second. This design choice maintains low-latency performance even if the sampling rate is increased (e.g., from 100 Hz to 10 kHz).

The use of the Platform Driver model and the Device Tree simplifies portability. The core logic of the driver can be easily ported to different ARM Cortex architectures (Cortex-A/M) common in i.MX platforms.


### 7. Conclusion.

Following a rigorous development and validation process , the Platform Driver module for the NXP Challenge is complete, fully operative and compliant with the engineering system requirements. The solution implements a robust system of Telemetry and Asinchronous Control, using the hrtimer of Kernel to production of Data and spinlocks to ensure atomic mutual exclusion of the Ring Buffer effectively preventing race conditions in multi-core environments. The Kernel-User Space interface is efficient and secure, leveraging poll/epoll for low lattency asynchronous event synchronization and sysfs for Dynamic configuration and diagnosis. The automated test confirms the sucess of the Alert Path (POLLPRI) and the overall robustness of Life Cycle of Kernel, demonstrating a solid domain of software development for embebdded systems in Linux environment.
